				<p>Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern sky, whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory. Its Latin name means &ldquo;greater (or larger) bear&rdquo;, standing as a reference to and in direct contrast with nearby Ursa Minor, the lesser bear. In antiquity, it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (2nd century CE), and is now the third largest constellation of the 88 modern constellations.</p>

				<p>Appearing in the northern sky, Ursa Major occupies a large area covering 1279.66 square degrees or 3.10% of the total sky, making it the third largest constellations in the night sky. Eug&egrave;ne Delporte in 1930, who set the official International Astronomical Union (IAU) constellation boundaries, formed a 28-sided irregular polygon, which according to the equatorial coordinate system, stretches between the right ascension coordinates of  08h 08.3m and  14h 29.0m and the declination coordinates of +28.30&deg; and +73.14&deg;. Ursa Major borders eight other constellations: Draco to the north and northeast, Bo&ouml;tes to the east, Canes Venatici to the east and southeast, Coma Berenices to the southeast, Leo and Leo Minor to the south, Lynx to the southwest and Camelopardalis to the northwest. The three-letter constellation abbreviation &ldquo;UMa&rdquo; was adopted by the IAU in 1922.</p>

				<p>Several bright galaxies are found in Ursa Major, including the pair Messier 81 (one of the brightest galaxies in the sky) and Messier 82 above the bear&rsquo;s head, and Pinwheel Galaxy (M101), a spiral northeast of Î· Ursae Majoris. The spiral galaxies Messier 108 and Messier 109 are also found in this constellation. The bright planetary nebula Owl Nebula (M97) can be found along the bottom of the bowl of the Big Dipper.</p>

				<p>HD 80606, a sun-like star in a binary system, orbits a common center of gravity with its partner, HD 80607; the two are separated by 1,200 AU on average. Research conducted in 2003 indicates that its sole planet, HD 80606 b is a future hot Jupiter, modeled to have evolved in a perpendicular orbit around 5 AU from its sun. The 4-Jupiter mass planet is projected to eventually move into a circular, more aligned orbit via the Kozai mechanism. However, it is currently on an incredibly eccentric orbit that ranges from approximately one astronomical unit at its apoapsis and six stellar radii at periapsis.</p>

				<p>Ursa Major has been reconstructed as an Indo-European constellation. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy in his Almagest, who called it <em>Arktos Megale</em>. It is mentioned by such poets as Homer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Tennyson and Federico Garcia Lorca (in &ldquo;Song for the Moon&rdquo;). The Finnish epic <em>Kalevala</em> mentions it. Vincent van Gogh painted it. It may be mentioned in the biblical book of Job, dated between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, although this is often disputed.</p>
